Stretch Goals
- [ ] - When state changes, update the value of each <progress> element. Hint: the jQuery .val() method updates the value attribute of HTML elements!
- [ ] - HP Regeneration: if freaky fungus's HP falls bellow 50, have it regenerate 1HP every second. Hint: look up the built in setInterval() function!
